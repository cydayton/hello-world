## Hello world!  Critique 1/14/19

Welcome to my first visual design coding project.  I chose to embellish one of my favorite pictures that I took on a sailing trip to St. Martin.  I enjoyed learning about cool graphic and animation features that can be implemented using the p5.js library.  Specifically, I have a better understanding of using grid dimensions to place images and shapes on a canvas.  I also explored animation opportunities as visible in the sun rotating, shark fins moving and jittering, and fish swimming.  This was possible by defining variables that changed incrementally or using for-loops, depending on the situation.  In addition, notice that if the mouse is pressed and dragged, a bird appears that is "flapping it's wings".  I learned about the mouseIsPressed, mouseX, and mouseY functions when I was programming this component.  They allow something to occur as a result of clicking the mouse, and the latter two functions allowed specifically for my bird to move with the mouse.  I am currently working on trying to "stamp" birds of random sizes wherever the mouse is clicked on the canvas.  My thought process is to somehow index a location whenever the mouse is clicked and have a bird subsequently appear at that location.  I have been able to do this for one mouse click, but after another click, the first bird is replaced by the second one.  I look forward to continuing to work on this part and expanding my work!
